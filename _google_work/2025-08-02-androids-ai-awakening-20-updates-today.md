###  Gemini 2.5 Deep Think is finally heading to Google AI Ultra users

### The inside story of building NotebookLM

Google's NotebookLM, née "Project Tailwind," went from a six-week hackathon project to a multilingual research assistant – proving that sometimes, even in Big Tech,  "move fast and break things" actually works (mostly).  The team cleverly used user feedback (forms *and* Discord – impressive!) to shape features like audio summaries, highlighting the importance of  user-centric design in the wild world of AI.  It's a reminder that even the most magical AI needs a bit of human touch (and maybe a decent mobile app). [Read more →](https://blog.google/technology/ai/developing-notebooklm/)

## Android + Circle to Search

### Q2 earnings call: CEO’s remarks

Google's Q2 earnings were stellar, driven largely by AI features like the surprisingly popular (over 2 billion users!) AI Overviews—apparently,  even search results can be "over-engineered" to success.  Meanwhile, AI Mode's US and India launch suggests Google's playing a global game of AI whack-a-mole, and developers everywhere are probably already scrambling to integrate.

[Read more →](https://blog.google/technology/health/google-france-ai-healthcare-hackathon/)

### A summer of security: empowering cyber defenders with AI

Google's throwing some serious AI firepower at cybersecurity this summer, promising faster vulnerability detection—think "Big Sleep" agent finding real flaws, not just theoretical ones.  Developers can look forward to boosted AI features in Timesketch,  so get ready to debug those security nightmares a little more efficiently (or at least with slightly less caffeine).

## Android Development

[Read more →](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/genai-processors/)

## 🔍 Key Takeaways

- Android's staying power, but AI's the real star:**  While a solid chunk of updates focus on Android itself (those 23 updates!), the real buzz seems to be around Google's AI advancements, with a whopping 42 updates in that category alone.  It's like Android's the reliable friend you always count on, but Google's AI is the exciting new party guest everyone's talking about.
- Gemini's slow rollout – a case of "good things come to those who wait (and have an Ultra phone)":**  The near-total absence of Gemini-related updates (especially considering the hype around Gemini 2.5) suggests a rollout strategy that's... deliberate, to say the least.  Looks like Google's playing it cool, ensuring a smooth experience for the select few (those with the fancy AI Ultra phones) before a wider release.
- The AI-powered future is slowly coming to Vertex AI:**  The mentions of Veo 3's fast video creation and NotebookLM show Google's quietly building out its AI tools on Vertex AI platform. It's a behind-the-scenes build-up suggesting big things are brewing for AI-powered video editing and more sophisticated AI applications in the future, though whether that’s good or bad depends on how you feel about robots taking our jobs.
- Uncategorized updates: A mystery, a hint of the future?**: That significant "Uncategorized" category (19 updates!) is a bit of a head-scratcher.  Perhaps it's where the truly groundbreaking stuff hides, or maybe it's just a sign that even Google sometimes needs a little more organizational AI in *its own* operations – ironic, huh?

## 🚀 Looking Ahead

Wow, what a whirlwind tour of the tech landscape!  Twenty updates across eight categories—from Android's cozy embrace of Gemini to the ever-evolving saga of AI integration (let's be honest, it's like watching a particularly exciting game of technological Jenga).  The interconnectedness of Android, AI, and even privacy concerns, as highlighted today, paints a fascinating picture of where we're headed. Will our phones one day anticipate our every need? Only time (and a lot more updates) will tell.  But one thing’s for sure:  staying informed is key to navigating this exciting, slightly chaotic, future.  So, buckle up, tech enthusiasts—and don't forget to subscribe to stay ahead of the curve!  We've got more exciting developments brewing, and you won't want to miss them.
