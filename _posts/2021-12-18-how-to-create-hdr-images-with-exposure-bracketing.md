Very often it happens that when we take pictures particularly with DSLR or phone camera without HDR the images turns out to be like this

<div style="text-align: center">
    <img src="../images/hdr/sample4_1.jpg"
      style="margin: auto; width: 100%; max-width: 700px;">
</div>

Even though from our eyes it'd look like this

<div style="text-align: center">
    <img src="../images/hdr/sample4_hdr.png"
      style="margin: auto; width: 100%; max-width: 700px;">
</div>

And a great photographer would capture it like this.

<div style="text-align: center">
    <img src="../images/hdr/sample4_hdr_2.png"
      style="margin: auto; width: 100%; max-width: 700px;">
</div>

This is all done with a technology called HDR — High Dynamic Range Imaging.
