## Placeholder at the moment!
If you are here, I suppose you came from my talk today! I am glad you did! I am unfortunately still writing a full transcript of today's talk.

It's going to have the following content:
> Result of my case study on different ways to write image processing algorithms in Android taking the example of YUV to ARGB conversion.

 - Different ways
 - Their performance numbers
 - My recommendations based on numbers and relative complexity of writing and maintaining them.

## They why did you share this link?

 The final article is going to be a super article referring to some of my write-ups so far. For now please take a look at those:

 - [Guiding C++ compiler to auto vectorize the code](https://blog.minhazav.dev/guide-compiler-to-auto-vectorise/)
 - [Faster image processing in Android Java using multi threading](https://blog.minhazav.dev/faster-image-processing-in-android-java-using-multi-threading/)
 - [How to use RenderScript to convert YUV_420_888 YUV Image to Bitmap](https://blog.minhazav.dev/how-to-use-renderscript-to-convert-YUV_420_888-yuv-image-to-bitmap/)


For the actual article I am hoping to finish it in a week's time. In the meantime, how about subscribing to my newsletter — that too is something I recently started. It's going to be about one of these topics:
 - Image processing or Computational photography
 - Algorithm optimizations
 - Photography
 - And very seldom about personal finance and hacks around that.

## Request for feedbacks on the talk
Also, I asked for some feedbacks around the talk, please take some time to fill it up - [here](https://forms.gle/KxfQbLKR1HE8nrKK8). It's fairly small, but it'd help me grow as a speaker and a blogger.
